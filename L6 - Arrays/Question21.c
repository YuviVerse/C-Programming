// Implement a function to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3". If the compressed string would not become smaller than the original string, your function should return the original string.
#include <stdio.h>

void compressString(char str[]) {
    // Your code here
}

int main() {
    char str[] = "aabcccccaaa";
    // Your code here to call compressString and print the result
    return 0;
}
